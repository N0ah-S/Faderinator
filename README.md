# Faderinator
This is a university project using the [RP2040 Launchpad](https://github.com/Terstegge/rp2040-launchpad-PCB), an RP2040-based microcontroller board developed by our professor,
and [YAHAL](https://git.fh-aachen.de/Terstegge/YAHAL), a hardware abstraction layer that works with the aforementioned launchpad. It has (currently) two modules: the microcontroller 
controlling a bunch of motor faders and sending the data to a computer, and a C# (no GUI yet) program that talks with the MCU and deligates the inputs to plugins, that are either 
directly part of this module *or with named pipes*[^1].
